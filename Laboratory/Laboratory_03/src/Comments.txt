Phase 1
- renaming everything based on their scope
- using mixed Camel Case naming convention
- removing magic numbers
- adding an enum for product types

Phase 2
- encapsulate values in the ProductType enum
- refactor the if-then-if-then....with a switch
- exit as fast as you can from the function - return finalPrice fast
- move some variables as constant static ones

Phase 3
- reduce methods complexity by Single Responsibility from SOLID
