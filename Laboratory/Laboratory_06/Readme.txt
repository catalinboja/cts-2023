Problem to solve

We are developing a game with different characters. Something like space invaders.
We will have different frameworks for
- space objects (planets, moons, meteorites, etc)
- space ships
- aliens
All classes provide different attributes and different contructors (different combinations of parameters)
Provide a solution that will allow devs to create all these things without being dependent on all these details. A loose coupling aproach (DIP). Future changes related to the creation of different objects should not affect the existing solution.
